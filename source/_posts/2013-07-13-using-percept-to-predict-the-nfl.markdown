Recently, I made some posts on [my blog](http://www.vikparuchuri.com) about how to use the Equirio [percept platform](http://www.github.com/equirio/percept) to predict NFL season records.

The [first post](http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/predicting-nfl-season-records-with-percept/) is an overview of the method, and the [second post](http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/predicting-season-records-for-nfl-teams-part-2/) goes into much more technical detail.

Both are worth a read if you are interested in percept, or if you are interested in predicting NFL records.
