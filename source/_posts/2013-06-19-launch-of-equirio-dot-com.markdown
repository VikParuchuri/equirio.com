Welcome!
--------------

Welcome to the site.  I recently re-did it using Jekyll, which is a pretty great way to generate static content.  I will be making a full post about the upsides and downsides of this shortly.

In the meanwhile, equirio is hard at work on the percept platform for data analysis.  [Check it out](http://github.com/equirio/percept-proto) if you have some time.
